        <p> Hello! My name is Kheri Gonzalez. I am a proud father of 3 girls and I am a lucky man becuase I married a great woman. I love spending time with the fam and I am a big football fan (go Patriots!), 
            and it's awesome when I get to mix family and football. I am a Data Analyst and I am getting my BS in Software Development because I want to start my own business and travel the world with my girls!</p>
